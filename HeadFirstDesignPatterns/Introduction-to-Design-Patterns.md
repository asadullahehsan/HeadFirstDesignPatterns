# Introduction to Design Patterns

## Why design patterns?  
Design patterns are fundamental to writing scalable, maintainable, and efficient code. By studying them, I aim to improve my ability to design robust software architectures.

## What's the benefit?
Understanding design patterns helps in:  
- Writing reusable and modular code  
- Improving problem-solving skills  
- Enhancing collaboration with other developers by following common architectural principles  

## Learning Journey  
Iâ€™m currently learning design patterns from *Head First Design Patterns* by @Eric Freeman & @Elisabeth Robson and implementing them in C#.
